Step Drainer is the most advanced drainer on the market. It supports most popular networks: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, zkSync, Base, Era, Pulse. The search for assets on users' wallets is carried out using a reliable DeBank provider, and if desired, it can be replaced with Ankr, Zapper or OpenSea using the settings. Drainer successfully copes with finding the main coin of the wallet, ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, which it also withdraws in a fully automatic mode.

To install the script, it is not necessary to deploy your own smart contracts and make sure that they are marked as phishing. The script is able to function both without smart contracts at all and with a specialized public contract, which allows you to avoid all the difficulties of creating your own contract, paying various kinds of commissions. and connections. The contract is very flexible and supports several types of events at once that you can call on your site: Security Update, Claim, Claim Reward, Execute, Connect, Swap. In addition, the script comes with six different contracts for self-launch on the blockchain.

Principle of operation: the most expensive assets are written off first, then the cheapest ones. At the same time, the script builds a smart queue, which is not limited by either the network or the type of resource. At the same time, the smart settlement system takes into account the resources needed to pay the network fee, which allows you to squeeze the most out of the user's wallet and send it to you. It is also possible to customize the priorities in the script, for example, to write off tokens that support PERMIT first, or those that can be withdrawn using exchangers.

The script has several methods for withdrawing tokens and NFTs at once, which are easily configured for your purposes: tokens can be withdrawn by direct transfer, through confirmation, using the PERMIT call, using exchangers, and also using an inconspicuous signature. Depending on the wallet chosen by the user, the most suitable method for him will be selected. By default, the most inconspicuous and effective is selected. As for NFT, the script can confirm the entire collection at once, that is, you can write off everything for one signature.

Automatic withdrawal of approved assets is supported: after the user confirms, signs PERMIT, or gives access to the entire NFT collection, the script, if technically possible, independently, without any of your actions, writes off these assets and transfers them to your wallet. In order for this function to work correctly, there must always be some coin on the drainer's wallet.

The script supports a huge number of wallets, over 300 to be exact. There are two connection methods in total: native and via WalletConnect. Native wallets work directly with the drainer and include: MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet. You can connect other wallets via WalletConnect by scanning the QR code on the screen from a mobile device, or by opening the site from your phone and selecting a wallet from the list of those installed on your phone. Most mobile wallets support WalletConnect. Works with both versions of WalletConnect.
